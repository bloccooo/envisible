# Envisible [envi]

A team secret manager. Secrets are stored encrypted in a storage backend of your choice (S3, R2, WebDAV, or local) and synced across team members using a [CRDT](https://automerge.org). No central server required.

## Encryption

Secret values are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a shared workspace key. That key is wrapped individually for each member via X25519 + ECIES, derived from their passphrase using argon2id. The passphrase never leaves the device.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloccooo/envisible/main/install.sh | bash
```

Supports macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel) and Linux (x64). Installs to `/usr/local/bin/envi`.

## Commands

### `envi setup`

Create a new workspace or join an existing one via an invite link.

```sh
envi setup                     # create workspace
envi setup envi-invite:<token> # join workspace
```

### `envi`

Open the terminal UI to manage secrets, projects, and members.

```sh
envi
```

**Key bindings:**

| Key   | Action                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| `n`   | New item                              |
| `e`   | Edit selected                         |
| `d`   | Delete selected                       |
| `s`   | Manage project secrets (project pane) |
| `g`   | Grant access to member (members pane) |
| `i`   | Generate invite link (members pane)   |
| `v`   | Toggle value visibility               |
| `Tab` | Switch pane                           |
| `q`   | Quit                                  |

### `envi run`

Inject secrets as environment variables into a command.

```sh
envi run -- node server.js
envi run --project myapp -- node server.js
envi run --project myapp --dry-run
```

A `.envi` file in the project root can specify the default project:

```
project = "myapp"
```

### `envi sync`

Pull the latest state from the storage backend and push local changes.

```sh
envi sync
```

### `envi logout`

Stop the key agent and clear cached credentials from RAM. The next command will prompt for the passphrase again.

```sh
envi logout
```

### `envi clear`

Remove all local data: stop the agent, delete the local cache, and remove the config from the OS keychain. Use this to fully reset the installation.

```sh
envi clear
```

## Security roadmap

The current implementation uses sound cryptographic primitives (AES-256-GCM, X25519/ECIES, Argon2id) but currently has known limitations.

**Known bugs:**

- **Password reuse across members** — because private keys are derived purely from `(passphrase, workspace_id)`, a member who knows another member's passphrase can derive their private key and decrypt secrets as them. There is no binding between a member's identity and their key material beyond the passphrase itself. Fixed by member identity verification (see below).
- **Member name impersonation** — member names are self-declared and not verified. Nothing prevents two members from registering with the same name, or a malicious joiner from choosing a name that mimics a legitimate member. Fixed by requiring the inviting member to countersign new members (see below).

**Planned hardening, roughly in priority order:**

- ~~**Remove passphrase persistence**~~ — done. The passphrase is never written to disk; the derived key is held only in RAM by a short-lived background agent and cleared on `envi logout`.
- **Signed invite links** — invite links will be signed by the issuing member's private key. Peers will verify the signature on join, ensuring the invite was issued by a legitimate workspace member and preventing forged or tampered links.
- **Member identity verification** — new members self-register by writing their own public key into the shared document. A future version will require the inviting member to countersign the joining member's public key, preventing a malicious actor from substituting their own key during the join flow.
- **Single-use, expiring invite links** — invite links currently have no expiry and can be reused indefinitely. They will include a short-lived nonce so that replayed or leaked links cannot be used to register new members.
- **Authenticated CRDT documents** — each member's automerge document will be signed with their private key. Peers will reject documents with invalid signatures, preventing a storage-level attacker from injecting rogue members or wiping secrets.
- **Scoped secret injection** — `envi run` will require secrets to be explicitly declared (e.g. in the `.envi` file) rather than injecting the full workspace vault, limiting the blast radius of prompt-injection attacks against AI agents.

## Building from source

Requires Rust (stable).

```sh
cargo build --release
```
